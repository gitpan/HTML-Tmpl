HTML/Tmpl version 1.4
======================

.::DESCRIPTION::.

        HTML::Tmpl is the lighter version of L<HTML::Template> module by Sam Trager (sam@trager.com)
    but with a lot less options. It uses JSP like styled tag sets (<% %>)

    As of version 1.1 HTML::Tmpl does only variable replacement. IF you want loop and if/else
    features to be available for your HTML templates, please go with L<HTML::Template>.
    Of course all the features HTML::Template offers are in my TODO list, and hopefully
    will appeare in the subsecquent versions of the library.

.::INSTALLATION::.


To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
